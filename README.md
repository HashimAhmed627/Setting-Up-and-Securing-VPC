# Setting Up and Securing VPC ‚òÅÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to set up and secure a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. It covers the entire process of creating a VPC, configuring subnets, setting up route tables, creating and attaching an Internet Gateway (IGW), configuring a NAT Gateway, implementing security groups and network ACLs (Access Control Lists), and launching EC2 instances within the VPC. The goal is to establish a secure and well-architected AWS network environment that allows controlled access while maintaining security best practices.

## Tasks Covered
- **Creating a VPC** ‚Äì Defining a new VPC with a custom CIDR block.

- **Creating Public and Private Subnets** ‚Äì Segmenting the VPC into public and private subnets.
- **Creating and Attaching an Internet Gateway (IGW)** ‚Äì Enabling internet access for public subnets.
- **Setting Up a NAT Gateway** ‚Äì Allowing private subnet instances to access the internet securely.
- **Configuring Route Tables** ‚Äì Associating route tables with subnets to manage traffic flow, including internet access via IGW and private subnet access via NAT Gateway.
- **Configuring Security Groups** ‚Äì Defining inbound and outbound rules for database servers and web servers.
- **Implementing Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)** ‚Äì Adding an additional layer of security at the subnet level to control traffic permissions.
- **Launching and Connecting to EC2 Instances** ‚Äì Deploying instances within the configured VPC and testing connectivity via SSH and HTTP.
- **Verifying Access and Testing Connectivity** ‚Äì Confirming network configurations by accessing the web server from a browser and testing database access through the web server.

### Creating a VPC
![vpc creation configurations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8576a82-7e84-46b4-b748-5f6b39a6314d)

- Created a VPC and named it "hashim-vpc"
- Manually specified an IPv4 CIDR block
- The CIDR block defines the range of available IP addresses in the VPC
- The slash notation (e.g., /16, /24) indicates how many bits are allocated for the network address. The remaining bits are used for host addresses
- Opted not to use an IPv6 CIDR block for this project, focusing solely on IPv4

- Created a public subnet named "PublicSubnet-1"
- The subnet is located in the **us-east-2a** Availability Zone
- Assigned a CIDR block of 10.0.5.0/24 to the subnet

- Configured a destination 0.0.0.0/0 (default route) to forward all outbound traffic.
- Set the target as hashim-igw to route traffic outside the VPC.

![publicroutetable officially associated with public subnets](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e95f5ed-012e-49ac-bdc0-bdc808f1c6c4)

- Successfully associated PublicRouteTable with PublicSubnet-1 and PublicSubnet-2.
#### Private Route Table

- Created a public route table named PublicRouteTable.
- Associated the route table with hashim-vpc to manage routing within the VPC.
  
![privateroutetable target is now NAT gateway](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c0c665e-7770-4c72-a1ed-806d5799d69a)

- Set the target of the route to hashim-NAT-gateway, enabling private subnet instances to access the internet securely through the NAT Gateway.

### Setting Up Security Groups
#### Web Server Security Group (Publicly Accessible)

- Created a security group named WebServerSG for my web server instance.
- Made the security group publicly accessible to allow internet traffic.
- Configured inbound rules:
  - Allowed HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic from anywhere.
  - Restricted SSH (port 22) traffic to only allow connections from my IP address for secure access.
#### Database Server Security Group (Not Publicly Accessible)

## Lessons Learned
- **Network Segmentation Enhances Security** ‚Äì Using public and private subnets helps isolate critical resources from direct internet exposure.

- **Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway Serve Different Purposes** ‚Äì The IGW allows public instances to communicate with the internet, while the NAT Gateway enables private instances to initiate outbound traffic securely.
- **Security Groups and ACLs Work Together** ‚Äì Security groups control traffic at the instance level, while network ACLs provide additional subnet-level filtering for better security enforcement.
- **Proper Route Table Configuration is Crucial** ‚Äì Ensuring that subnets are correctly associated with the right route tables determines whether instances have access to external or internal resources.
- **Testing is Key** ‚Äì Verifying SSH access, web connectivity, and database reachability ensures that the network is configured as expected.
