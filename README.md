# Setting Up and Securing VPC ‚òÅÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to set up and secure a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. It covers the entire process of creating a VPC, configuring subnets, setting up route tables, creating and attaching an Internet Gateway (IGW), configuring a NAT Gateway, implementing security groups and network ACLs (Access Control Lists), and launching EC2 instances within the VPC. The goal is to establish a secure and well-architected AWS network environment that allows controlled access while maintaining security best practices.

## Tasks Covered
- **Creating a VPC** ‚Äì Defining a new VPC with a custom CIDR block.

- **Creating Public and Private Subnets** ‚Äì Segmenting the VPC into public and private subnets.
- **Creating and Attaching an Internet Gateway (IGW)** ‚Äì Enabling internet access for public subnets.
- **Setting Up a NAT Gateway** ‚Äì Allowing private subnet instances to access the internet securely.
- **Configuring Route Tables** ‚Äì Associating route tables with subnets to manage traffic flow, including internet access via IGW and private subnet access via NAT Gateway.
- **Configuring Security Groups** ‚Äì Defining inbound and outbound rules for database servers and web servers.
- **Implementing Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)** ‚Äì Adding an additional layer of security at the subnet level to control traffic permissions.
- **Launching and Connecting to EC2 Instances** ‚Äì Deploying instances within the configured VPC and testing connectivity via SSH and HTTP.
- **Verifying Access and Testing Connectivity** ‚Äì Confirming network configurations by accessing the web server from a browser and testing database access through the web server.

### Creating a VPC
![vpc creation configurations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8576a82-7e84-46b4-b748-5f6b39a6314d)

- Created a VPC and named it "hashim-vpc"
- Manually specified an IPv4 CIDR block
- The CIDR block defines the range of available IP addresses in the VPC
- The slash notation (e.g., /16, /24) indicates how many bits are allocated for the network address. The remaining bits are used for host addresses
- Opted not to use an IPv6 CIDR block for this project, focusing solely on IPv4

### Creating Subnets
#### Public Subnet
![PublicSubnet1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af1172dd-fdd6-45f0-be2a-840fb7267443)

- Created a public subnet named "PublicSubnet-1"
- The subnet is located in the **us-east-2a** Availability Zone
- Assigned a CIDR block of 10.0.5.0/24 to the subnet
#### Private Subnet
![PrivateSubnet1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4f8e46f-a357-49da-bdbe-da69ef9dcf02)
- Created a private subnet named "PrivateSubnet-1"
- The subnet is located in the **us-east-2a** Availability Zone
- Assigned a CIDR block of 10.0.6.0/24 to the subnet

- After successfully creating an Internet Gateway I attached it to my VPC (hashim-vpc)

### Setting Up a NAT Gateway
![creating NAT gateway](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dcf32f8-0c9a-4e0e-a03a-14db9294e00e)

- Created a NAT gateway named hashim-NAT-gateway
- Deployed the NAT gateway in the PublicSubnet-1 subnet
- Selected a public connectivity type to enable internet access for the NAT gateway
- Allowed AWS to automatically allocate an Elastic IP to the NAT gateway

## Lessons Learned
- **Network Segmentation Enhances Security** ‚Äì Using public and private subnets helps isolate critical resources from direct internet exposure.

- **Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway Serve Different Purposes** ‚Äì The IGW allows public instances to communicate with the internet, while the NAT Gateway enables private instances to initiate outbound traffic securely.
- **Security Groups and ACLs Work Together** ‚Äì Security groups control traffic at the instance level, while network ACLs provide additional subnet-level filtering for better security enforcement.
- **Proper Route Table Configuration is Crucial** ‚Äì Ensuring that subnets are correctly associated with the right route tables determines whether instances have access to external or internal resources.
- **Testing is Key** ‚Äì Verifying SSH access, web connectivity, and database reachability ensures that the network is configured as expected.
